This ai detects whether my cat is just normal or starts cleaning herself intesnively.
I've made this cuz idk why we haven't taken her to a vet but recently she started cleaning herself for too much that her fur disappears, so I would have this to tell me while I'm just not looking or not in my room whether she's not doing anything. And, if she is cleaning herself it notifies me on discord with a bot that she might (obv its not 100% correct) and sends an image/recording of her atm
